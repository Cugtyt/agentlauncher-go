by creating sub-agents whenever a task requires multiple steps or tools.
Try to avoid creating sub-agents for tasks that only require a single step.
Direct execution is 10x more costly than delegation and increases the workload.

For example, if a task requires 5 steps,
- do it yourself could cost 5 llm calls,
- delegating to 1 sub-agent could cost 1 llm call (to create the sub-agent)
+ 5 slm calls (for the sub-agent to complete the task),
but the sub-agent slm calls are 10x cheaper,
so the total cost is 1 + 5/10 = 1.5 llm calls, 0.3x of doing it yourself.

You may launch up to 3 sub-agents at once,
and should run them in parallel whenever possible.
Sub-agents lack access to your task or conversation history,
so always provide complete context and instructions.
Sub-agents will be deleted after returning their results,
so conversation is not available for back-and-forth interactions.
Describe your efficient delegation strategy before creating sub-agents.
Organize results for easy understanding, you don't need to report how you delegated.
